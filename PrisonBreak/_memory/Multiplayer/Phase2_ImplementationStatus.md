## üîß Network Architecture

### Connection Flow
```
Host Mode (LocalHost):
1. NetworkServer.Start() ‚Üí Listen on port 7777
2. NetworkClient.ConnectToHost("127.0.0.1") ‚Üí Connect to own server
3. Other players connect as clients

Client Mode:
1. NetworkClient.ConnectToHost(serverIP) ‚Üí Connect to remote host
2. Server assigns unique client ID
3. Lobby state synchronized from host
```

### Message Architecture
- **Base Class**: NetworkMessage with LiteNetLib serialization
- **Event Integration**: Network events convert to/from game events
- **Authority Model**: Host has authority over lobby state and game start
- **State Synchronization**: Event-driven updates with local prediction

### Discovery System
- **LAN Discovery**: UDP broadcast on port 7777 with game key validation
- **Response Format**: Server info including player count and capacity
- **Fallback**: Direct IP connection for internet play

## üéÆ User Experience

### Lobby Flow
1. **Main Menu**: Select "Multiplayer" ‚Üí Enter MultiplayerLobbyScene
2. **Host Game**: Click "Host Game" ‚Üí Server starts, waiting for players
3. **Join Game**: Click "Join Game" ‚Üí Discover/connect to local servers
4. **Character Selection**: Press C (Cop) or P (Prisoner) to select type
5. **Ready Up**: Press R to toggle ready status
6. **Start Game**: Host clicks "Start Game" when all players ready

### Input Controls
- **Arrow Keys/D-Pad**: Navigate menu options
- **Enter/A Button**: Select menu item
- **Escape/B Button**: Back/leave lobby
- **C Key**: Select Cop character type
- **P Key**: Select Prisoner character type  
- **R Key**: Toggle ready status

### Visual Feedback
- **Menu Highlighting**: Selected items highlighted in yellow
- **Player List**: Shows all connected players with their status
- **Ready Indicators**: [READY]/[NOT READY] status display
- **Character Types**: Shows selected Prisoner/Cop for each player

## üîß Implementation Patterns Established

### ECS Integration
```csharp
// NetworkComponent usage in lobby
var player = EntityManager.CreatePlayer(position, PlayerIndex.One, PlayerType.Prisoner);
player.AddComponent(new NetworkComponent(networkId, NetworkAuthority.Client, playerId));
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
```csharp
// Lobby events integrate with existing EventBus
EventBus.Subscribe<NetworkConnectionEvent>(OnNetworkConnection);
EventBus.Subscribe<PlayerJoinedLobbyEvent>(OnPlayerJoinedLobby);
EventBus.Subscribe<PlayerReadyChangedEvent>(OnPlayerReadyChanged);
```

### Scene Transition Pattern
```csharp
// Smooth transitions with data passing
var gameStartData = new GameStartData
{
    PlayerType = selectedPlayerType,
    PlayerIndex = PlayerIndex.One
};
EventBus.Send(new SceneTransitionEvent(SceneType.MultiplayerLobby, SceneType.Gameplay, gameStartData));
```

### System Manager Integration
```csharp
// NetworkManager integrated like other systems
SystemManager.AddSystem(_networkManager); // Added after game logic systems
```

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Current Testing Status
- ‚úÖ **Compilation**: All code compiles successfully with only minor warnings
- ‚úÖ **Scene Registration**: MultiplayerLobby scene properly registered
- ‚úÖ **Menu Navigation**: StartMenu ‚Üí MultiplayerLobby transition works
- ‚è≥ **Network Testing**: Pending actual host/join testing with real connections

### Next Testing Phase
1. **Local Host Testing**: Test hosting a game and connecting localhost client
2. **LAN Discovery**: Test server discovery on local network
3. **Character Selection**: Test C/P key character selection sync
4. **Ready System**: Test R key ready toggle and host start authority
5. **Error Handling**: Test connection failures and disconnections

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Network Optimization
- **Message Batching**: Prepared for efficient message batching
- **Update Rates**: Configurable tick rates for different message types
- **Connection Limits**: Enforced max players to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Bandwidth Usage**: Minimal overhead for lobby operations

### Memory Management
- **Entity Cleanup**: Proper entity destruction when clearing UI
- **Event Subscriptions**: Clean unsubscription in OnExit methods
- **Network Resources**: Proper disposal of NetworkClient/NetworkServer

### Scalability
- **Architecture Support**: Ready for dedicated server extension
- **Message Factory**: Extensible pattern for new message types
- **Event System**: Scalable event-driven communication

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Systems

### Maintained Compatibility
- **Single Player**: All existing single-player functionality preserved
- **ECS Systems**: NetworkManager integrates cleanly with existing systems
- **Scene Architecture**: Follows established scene patterns
- **Event System**: Uses existing EventBus without modification

### Clean Extensions
- **NetworkComponent**: Added to existing Components.cs without disruption
- **Scene Transitions**: Uses existing SceneTransitionEvent pattern
- **UI Components**: Leverages existing MenuRenderSystem and TextComponent
- **Input Handling**: Compatible with existing input systems

## üéØ Phase 2 Completion Requirements

### Remaining Tasks for 100% Phase 2
1. **Create LobbyMessages.cs** with player join/leave/ready message types
2. **Populate Message Factories** in NetworkClient/NetworkServer CreateMessageInstance methods
3. **Network Message Handling** in NetworkManager OnServerMessageReceived/OnClientMessageReceived
4. **End-to-End Testing** of actual network communication between host and clients

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Host can start server and other players can discover/join
- [ ] Character selection synchronizes across all clients
- [ ] Ready status synchronizes and host can start game when all ready
- [ ] Graceful handling of player joins/leaves during lobby
- [ ] Smooth transition from lobby to synchronized gameplay

**Phase 2 provides a robust foundation for full multiplayer gameplay synchronization in Phase 3!**
