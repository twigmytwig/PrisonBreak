## üêõ Known Issues

### 1. Remote Player Movement is Choppy
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: Known Issue  
**Description**: Remote player movement appears choppy/stuttery due to network synchronization updates.

**Technical Details**:
- NetworkSyncSystem sends position updates at 20Hz
- Position updates are applied instantly without interpolation
- Results in visible "teleporting" between network update positions
- Local player movement is smooth (no network dependency)

**Potential Solutions** (Future Enhancement):
- Implement client-side interpolation between network position updates
- Add movement prediction for remote players
- Consider increasing network update rate to 30-60Hz
- Implement smoothing/lerping between received positions

**Workaround**: None currently - this is expected behavior for the current implementation phase.

## üîß Fixed Issues

### 1. Client Player Cannot Move (FIXED)
**Date Fixed**: January 30, 2025  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Root Cause**: Client player spawning inside collision tiles/walls

**Issue Description**:
- Host player could move normally
- Client player could not move at all
- Input system was working correctly (keyboard detected, events sent)
- Movement system was receiving events correctly
- Network synchronization was working

**Root Cause Analysis**:
The multiplayer spawn system was placing players using a simple offset:
```csharp
Vector2 spawnOffset = new Vector2(i * 64, 0); // 64 pixels apart
```

This caused the client (player 2) to spawn 64 pixels to the right of the host, which often placed them inside walls or solid tiles. The tile-based collision system prevented movement when stuck in solid geometry.

**Solution Implemented**:
```csharp
// Improved spawn positioning with safe areas
if (i == 0)
{
    // First player spawns left of center  
    playerSpawnPos = new Vector2(baseSpawnPos.X - 128, baseSpawnPos.Y);
}
else  
{
    // Second player spawns right of center with more space
    playerSpawnPos = new Vector2(baseSpawnPos.X + 250, baseSpawnPos.Y);
}
```

**Lessons Learned**:
- Always test spawn positions in different map layouts
- Consider collision detection when placing multiplayer entities
- Tile-based collision can silently prevent movement if entities spawn in walls
- Simple offset spawning is insufficient for complex level geometry

## üß™ Debugging Process Used

### Client Movement Issue Debugging Steps:
1. **Input System Check**: Verified keyboard input detection - ‚úÖ Working
2. **Event System Check**: Verified PlayerInputEvent sending - ‚úÖ Working  
3. **Movement System Check**: Verified event reception - ‚úÖ Working
4. **Network Sync Check**: Identified NetworkSyncSystem ownership issues - üîß Fixed
5. **Spawn Position Check**: Identified wall collision issue - üîß Fixed

### Key Debug Techniques:
- Systematic component-by-component verification
- Comparing host vs client behavior patterns
- Network message flow analysis
- Ownership and authority validation
- Spatial position analysis

## üîç Testing Recommendations

### Before Each Release:
1. **Multi-spawn Testing**: Test player spawning on different map areas
2. **Wall Collision Testing**: Verify no players spawn inside solid tiles
3. **Movement Testing**: Both host and client movement in all directions
4. **Network Authority**: Verify ownership checks prevent feedback loops
5. **Entity Count**: Verify all expected entities exist on all clients

### Test Scenarios:
- **2-Player Setup**: One host, one client
- **Character Types**: Test both Cop and Prisoner selections
- **Map Coverage**: Test spawning in different room configurations
- **Connection Flow**: Test lobby ‚Üí gameplay ‚Üí lobby transitions
- **Disconnection**: Test graceful disconnect handling
