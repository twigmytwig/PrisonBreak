## Technical Considerations

### Network Message Types
- **Reliable**: Critical game state (inventory changes, item pickups)
- **Unreliable**: Frequent updates (position, rotation)
- **Ordered**: Sequence-dependent events (interactions, collisions)

### Security Measures
- Server-side validation for all critical actions
- Rate limiting for client messages
- Sanity checks for position updates
- Authority validation for entity modifications

### Performance Targets
- **Latency**: < 100ms for local network, < 200ms for internet
- **Bandwidth**: < 1KB/s per player for typical gameplay
- **Update Rate**: 20Hz for positions, 60Hz for input
- **Max Players**: 4-8 players initially, scalable to 16+

### Backward Compatibility
- Multiplayer code should not break single-player functionality
- Existing ECS systems should work with minimal modifications
- Network components should be optional and additive
