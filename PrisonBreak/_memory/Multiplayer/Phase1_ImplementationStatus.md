## 🏗️ Architecture Restructure

### Initial Problem
The original design placed all networking code in `PrisonBreak.Multiplayer` project, but this created **circular dependency issues**:
- `PrisonBreak` → `PrisonBreak.Multiplayer` (main game references networking)
- `PrisonBreak.Multiplayer` → `PrisonBreak` (networking needs ECS components)

### Solution: Separation of Concerns
**Before Restructure:**
```
PrisonBreak.Multiplayer/     # Everything networking
├── Core/NetworkManager.cs   # Needs ECS integration
├── Core/NetworkComponent.cs # Needs ECS types
└── Messages/ComponentMessages.cs  # Needs game components
```

**After Restructure:**
```
PrisonBreak.Multiplayer/     # Pure networking library
├── Core/NetworkConfig.cs    # No dependencies
└── Messages/NetworkMessage.cs  # Only LiteNetLib

PrisonBreak/                  # Game integration
├── Managers/NetworkManager.cs      # IGameSystem integration
├── ECS/Components.cs (NetworkComponent)  # With other components
└── Core/Networking/ComponentMessages.cs  # Game-specific messages
```

### Benefits Achieved
- ✅ **Eliminates Circular Dependencies** - Clean one-way dependency flow
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns** - Pure networking vs. game logic
- ✅ **Reusable Library** - PrisonBreak.Multiplayer can be used by other projects
- ✅ **Both Projects Build** - No complex workarounds needed
- ✅ **Cleaner Architecture** - Obvious separation of responsibilities

## 🏗️ Architectural Decisions Made

### 1. P2P Design Choice
**Decision**: Implemented peer-to-peer networking for Phase 1  
**Rationale**: Simpler to develop, test, and deploy initially  
**Future**: Can extend to dedicated servers by adding `DedicatedServer` to `GameMode` enum

### 2. Concrete MessageType Implementation
**Decision**: Used concrete property instead of abstract  
**Original Plan**: Abstract property requiring override in each message class  
**Actual Implementation**: Concrete property set in constructor  
**Benefit**: Simpler, less boilerplate code

### 3. Event Subscription Pattern
**Decision**: Always subscribe to events, filter by game mode  
**Alternative Considered**: Subscribe/unsubscribe based on mode changes  
**Benefit**: Simpler state management, no subscription lifecycle issues

### 4. Component Integration Approach  
**Decision**: NetworkComponent only added to entities needing sync  
**Benefit**: Performance optimization, clear distinction between networked/local entities

### 5. Architecture Restructure Decision
**Decision**: Split networking code between pure library and game integration  
**Original Problem**: Circular dependencies preventing compilation  
**Solution**: Clean separation of concerns with one-way dependencies  
**Impact**: Both projects now build successfully, cleaner maintainable code

## 🔧 Implementation Patterns Established

### Event-Bridge Pattern (NetworkManager)
```csharp
// Always subscribe, filter by mode
private void OnPlayerInput(PlayerInputEvent inputEvent)
{
    if (CurrentGameMode == NetworkConfig.GameMode.SinglePlayer)
        return;
    // Convert to network message and send
}
```

### Component Selective Sync
```csharp
// Fine-grained control over what gets networked
new NetworkComponent(networkId, authority,
    syncTransform: true,   // Player position
    syncMovement: false,   // Local prediction
    syncInventory: true);  // Item changes
```

### LiteNetLib Integration
```csharp
// Clean separation of message header and data
public void Serialize(NetDataWriter writer)
{
    writer.Put((byte)Type);    // Header
    writer.Put(EntityId);      // Header
    SerializeData(writer);     // Subclass data
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy Established

### Phase 1 Testing Approach
1. **Unit Testing**: Individual component serialization
2. **Integration Testing**: NetworkManager with existing systems
3. **Mode Switching**: SinglePlayer ↔ LocalHost ↔ Client transitions
4. **Event Flow**: Verify event → network message conversion

### Ready for Phase 2 Testing
- ✅ Foundation can be tested with mock NetworkClient/NetworkServer
- ✅ Event system integration verified
- ✅ Component patterns established
- ✅ Architecture supports lobby implementation

- [x] Core networking infrastructure complete
- [x] ECS integration patterns established  
- [x] Event system integration working
- [x] Message serialization framework ready
- [x] Game mode management implemented
- [x] Documentation updated

### 🎯 Phase 2 Entry Points
1. **NetworkClient.cs** - Implement LiteNetLib client wrapper
2. **NetworkServer.cs** - Implement LiteNetLib server wrapper  
3. **LobbyScene.cs** - Create multiplayer lobby interface
4. **LobbyMessages.cs** - Player join/leave/ready messages

## 🔍 Code Quality Notes

### Strengths
- **Non-Intrusive**: Single-player functionality unchanged
